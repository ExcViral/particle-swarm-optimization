class Particle:
    """
    This class is an implementation of the "particles" in the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

    Every solution in the solution space is called a particle. Philosophically, the particles change their components
    and move/fly in the space, with an intent to reach their destination, which may be food (solution), or anything else.

    Each particle is characterized by a position vector, and a velocity vector.

    Each particle has individual knowledge pbest-its own best-so-far position, and social knowledge gbest-pbest of its
    best neighbours.
