class Swarm:
    """
    This class is an implementation of the swarm in particle swarm implementation.

    PSO is initialized with a group (swarm) of random particles (solutions) and then searches for optima by updating
    generations.

    In every iteration, each particle is updated by following two "best" values. The first one is the best solution
    (fitness) it has achieved so far. (The fitness value is also stored.) This value is called pbest. Another "best"
    value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the
    population. This best value is a global best and called gbest.
